<b><a name="ANTINOMIES_ON_A_RAILWAY_STATION" id="ANTINOMIES_ON_A_RAILWAY_STATION"></a>ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION</b><br />
<br />
<br />
As I stand waiting in the rain<br />
For the foggy hoot of the London train,<br />
Gazing at silent wall and lamp<br />
And post and rail and platform damp,<br />
What is this power that comes to my sight<br />
That I see a night without the night,<br />
That I see them clear, yet look them through,<br />
The silvery things and the darkly blue,<br />
That the solid wall seems soft as death,<br />
A wavering and unanchored wraith,<br />
And rails that shine and stones that stream<br />
Unsubstantial as a dream?<br />
What sudden door has opened so,<br />
What hand has passed, that I should know<br />
This moving vision not of trance<br />
That melts the globe of circumstance,<br />
This sight that marks not least or most<br />
And makes a stone a passing ghost?<br />
<br />
Is it that a year ago<br />
I stood upon this self-same spot;<br />
Is it that since a year ago<br />
The place and I have altered not;<br />
Is it that I half forgot,<br />
A year ago, and all despised<br />
For a space the things that I had prized:<br />
The race of life, the glittering show?<br />
Is it that now a year has passed<br />
Of vain pursuit of glittering things,<br />
Of fruitless searching, shouting, running,<br />
And greedy lies and candour cunning,<br />
Here as I stand the year above<br />
Sudden the heats and the strivings fail<br />
And fall away, a fluctuant veil,<br />
And the fixed familiar stones restore<br />
The old appearance-buried core,<br />
The moveless and essential me,<br />
The eternal personality<br />
Alone enduring first and last?<br />
<br />
No, this I have known in other ways,<br />
In other places, other days.<br />
Not only here, on this one peak,<br />
Do fixity and beauty speak<br />
Of the delusiveness of change,<br />
Of the transparency of form,<br />
The bootless stress of minds that range,<br />
The awful calm behind the storm.<br />
In many places, many days,<br />
The invaded soul receives the rays<br />
Of countries she was nurtured in,<br />
Speaks in her silent language strange<br />
To that beyond which is her kin.<br />
Even in peopled streets at times<br />
A metaphysic arm is thrust<br />
Through the partitioning fabric thin,<br />
And tears away the darkening pall<br />
Cast by the bright phenomenal,<br />
And clears the obscured spirit's mirror<br />
From shadows of deceptive error,<br />
And shows the bells and all their ringing,<br />
And all the crowds and all their singing,<br />
Carillons that are nothing's chimes<br />
And dust that is not even dust....<br />
But rarely hold I converse thus<br />
Where shapes are bright and clamorous,<br />
More often comes the word divine<br />
In places motionless and far;<br />
Beneath the white peculiar shine<br />
Of sunless summer afternoons;<br />
At eventide on pale lagoons<br />
Where hangs reflected one pale star;<br />
Or deep in the green solitudes<br />
Of still erect entrancèd woods.<br />
<br />
O, in the woods alone lying,<br />
Scarce a bough in the wind sighing,<br />
Gaze I long with fervid power<br />
At leaf and branch and grass and flower,<br />
Breathe I breaths of trembling sight<br />
Shed from great urns of green delight,<br />
Take I draughts and drink them up<br />
Poured from many a stalk and cup.<br />
Now do I burn for nothing more<br />
Than thus to gaze, thus to adore<br />
This exquisiteness of nature ever<br />
In silence....<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">But with instant light</span><br />
Rends the film; with joy I quiver<br />
To see with new celestial sight<br />
Flower and leaf and grass and tree,<br />
Doomed barks on an eternal sea,<br />
Flit phantom-like as transient smoke.<br />
Beauty herself her spell has broke,<br />
Beauty, the herald and the lure,<br />
Her message told, may not endure;<br />
Her portal opened, she has died,<br />
Supreme immortal suicide.<br />
Yes, sleepless nature soundless flings<br />
Invisible grapples round the soul,<br />
Drawing her through the web of things<br />
To the primal end of her journeyings,<br />
Her ultimate and constant pole.<br />
<br />
For Beauty with her hands that beckon<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is but the Prophet of a Higher,</span><br />
A flaming and ephemeral beacon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A Phoenix perishing by fire.</span><br />
Herself from us herself estranges,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Herself her mighty tale doth kill,</span><br />
That all things change yet nothing changes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That all things move yet all are still.</span><br />
<br />
I cannot sink, I cannot climb,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now that I see my ancient dwelling,</span><br />
The central orb untouched of time,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And taste a peace all bliss excelling.</span><br />
Now I have broken Beauty's wall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now that my kindred world I hold,</span><br />
I care not though the cities fall<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the green earth go cold.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><a name="THE_THREE_HILLS" id="THE_THREE_HILLS"></a>THE THREE HILLS</b><br />
<br />
<br />
There were three hills that stood alone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With woods about their feet.</span><br />
They dreamed quiet when the sun shone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And whispered when the rain beat.</span><br />
<br />
They wore all three their coronals<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till men with houses came</span><br />
And scored their heads with pits and walls<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thought the hills were tame.</span><br />
<br />
Red and white when day shines bright<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They hide the green for miles,</span><br />
Where are the old hills gone? At night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The moon looks down and smiles.</span><br />
<br />
She sees the captors small and weak,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She knows the prisoners strong,</span><br />
She hears the patient hills that speak:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Brothers, it is not long;</span><br />
<br />
"Brothers, we stood when they were not<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ten thousand summers past.</span><br />
Brothers, when they are clean forgot<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We shall outlive the last;</span><br />
<br />
"One shall die and one shall flee<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With terror in his train,</span><br />
And earth shall eat the stones, and we<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall be alone again."</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><a name="A_CHANT" id="A_CHANT"></a>A CHANT</b><br />
<br />
<br />
Gently the petals fall as the tree gently sways<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That has known many springs and many petals fall</span><br />
Year after year to strew the green deserted ways<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the statue and the pond and the low, broken wall.</span><br />
<br />
Faded is the memory of old things done,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Peace floats on the ruins of ancient festival;</span><br />
They lie and forget in the warmth of the sun,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a sky silver-blue arches over all.</span><br />
<br />
O softly, O tenderly, the heart now stirs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With desires faint and formless; and, seeking not, I find</span><br />
Quiet thoughts that flash like azure king-fishers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Across the luminous tranquil mirror of the mind.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><a name="ARTEMIS_ALTERA" id="ARTEMIS_ALTERA"></a>ARTEMIS ALTERA</b><br />
<br />
<br />
O full of candour and compassion,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whom love and worship both would praise,</span><br />
Love cannot frame nor worship fashion<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The image of your fearless ways!</span><br />
<br />
How show your noble brow's dark pallor,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your chivalrous casque of ebon hair,</span><br />
Your eyes' bright strength, your lips' soft valour,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your supple shoulders and hands that dare?</span><br />
<br />
Our souls when naïvely you examine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your sword of innocence, flaming, huge,</span><br />
Sweeps over us, and there is famine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within the ports of subterfuge.</span><br />
<br />
You hate contempt and love not laughter;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With your sharp spear of virgin will</span><br />
You harry the wicked strong; but after,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O huntress who could never kill,</span><br />
<br />
Should they be trodden down or pierced,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Swift, swift, you fly with burning cheek</span><br />
To place your beauty's shield reversed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Above the vile defenceless weak!</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><a name="STARLIGHT" id="STARLIGHT"></a>STARLIGHT</b><br />
<br />
<br />
Last night I lay in an open field<br />
And looked at the stars with lips sealed;<br />
No noise moved the windless air,<br />
And I looked at the stars with steady stare.<br />
<br />
There were some that glittered and some that shone<br />
With a soft and equal glow, and one<br />
That queened it over the sprinkled round,<br />
Swaying the host with silent sound.<br />
<br />
"Calm things," I thought, "in your cavern blue,<br />
I will learn and hold and master you;<br />
I will yoke and scorn you as I can,<br />
For the pride of my heart is the pride of a man."<br />
<br />
Grass to my cheek in the dewy field<br />
I lay quite still with lips sealed,<br />
And the pride of a man and his rigid gaze<br />
Stalked like swords on heaven's ways.<br />
<br />
But through a sudden gate there stole<br />
The Universe and spread in my soul;<br />
Quick went my breath and quick my heart,<br />
And I looked at the stars with lips apart.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><a name="FLORIANS_SONG" id="FLORIANS_SONG"></a>FLORIAN'S SONG</b><br />
<br />
<br />
My soul, it shall not take us,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O we will escape</span><br />
This world that strives to break us<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And cast us to its shape;</span><br />
Its chisel shall not enter,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its fire shall not touch,</span><br />
Hard from rim to centre,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We will not crack or smutch.</span><br />
<br />
'Gainst words sweet and flowered<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We have an amulet,</span><br />
We will not play the coward<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For any black threat;</span><br />
If we but give endurance<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To what is now within&mdash;</span><br />
The single assurance<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That it is good to win.</span><br />
<br />
Slaves think it better<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To be weak than strong,</span><br />
Whose hate is a fetter<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And their love a thong.</span><br />
But we will view those others<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With eyes like stone,</span><br />
And if we have no brothers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We will walk alone.</span><br />

<b><a name="DIALOGUE" id="DIALOGUE"></a>DIALOGUE</b><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE ONE</span><br />
<br />
The dead man's gone, the live man's<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">sad, the dying leaf shakes on the tree,</span><br />
The wind constrains the window panes and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">moans like moaning of the sea,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sour's the taste now culled in haste of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">lovely things I won too late,</span><br />
And loud and loud above the crowd the<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Voice of One more strong than we.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE OTHER</span><br />
<br />
This Voice you hear, this call you fear, is<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">it unprophesied or new?</span><br />
Were you so insolent to think its rope would<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">never circle you?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Did you then beastlike live and walk with</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">ears and eyes that would not turn?</span><br />
Who bade you hope your service 'scape in<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">that eternal retinue?</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE ONE</span><br />
<br />
No; for I swear now bare's the tree and loud<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">the moaning of the wind,</span><br />
I walked no rut with eyelids shut, my ears<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">and eyes were never blind,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Only my eager thoughts I bent on many</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">things that I desired</span><br />
To make my greedy heart content ere flesh<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">and blood I left behind.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE OTHER</span><br />
<br />
Ignorance, then, was all your fault and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">filmèd eyes that could not know,</span><br />
That half discerned and never learned the<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">temporal way that men must go;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You set the image of the world high for</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">your heart's idolatry,</span><br />
Though with your lips you called the world<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">a toy, a ghost, a passing show.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE ONE</span><br />
<br />
No, no; this is not true; my lips spoke<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">only what my heart believed.</span><br />
Called I the world a toy; I spoke not echo-like<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">or self-deceived.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But that I thought the toy was mine to play</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">with, and the passing show</span><br />
Would sate at least my passing lusts, and did<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">not, therefore am I grieved.</span><br />
<br />
What did I do that I must bear this lifelong<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">tyranny of my fate,</span><br />
That I must writhe in bonds unsought of<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">accidental love and hate?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had chance but joinèd different dice, but</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">once or twice, but once or twice,</span><br />
All lovely things that I desired I should have<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">held before too late.</span><br />
<br />
Surely I knew that flesh was grass nor valued<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">overmuch the prize,</span><br />
But all the powers of chance conspired to<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">cheat a man both just and wise.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Happy I'd been had I but had my due</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">reward, and not a sword</span><br />
Flaming in diabolic hand between me and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">my Paradise.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE OTHER</span><br />
<br />
No hooded band of fates did stand your<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">heart's ambitions to gainsay,</span><br />
No flaming brand in evil hand was ever<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">thrust across your way,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Only the things all men must meet, the</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">common attributes of men,</span><br />
That men may flinch to see or, seeing, deny,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">but avoid them no man may.</span><br />
<br />
Fall the dice, not once or twice but always, to<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">make the self-same sum;</span><br />
Chance what may, a life's a life and to a<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">single goal must come;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though a man search far and wide, never</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">is hunger satisfied;</span><br />
Nature brings her natural fetters, man is<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">meshed and the wise are dumb.</span><br />
<br />
O vain all art to assuage a heart with accents<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">of a mortal tongue,</span><br />
All earthly words are incomplete and only<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">sweet are the songs unsung,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Never yet was cause for regret, yet regret</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">must afflict us all,</span><br />
Better it were to grasp the world 'thwart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">which this world is a curtain flung.</span><br />
<br />
<br />

No creature stirs in the wide fields.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The rifted western heaven yields</span><br />
The dying sun's illumination.<br />
This is the hour of tribulation<br />
When, with clear sight of eve engendered,<br />
Day's homage to delusion rendered,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mute at her window sits the soul.</span><br />
<br />
Clouds and skies and lakes and seas,<br />
Valleys and hills and grass and trees,<br />
Sun, moon, and stars, all stand to her<br />
Limbs of one lordless challenger,<br />
Who, without deigning taunt or frown,<br />
Throws a perennial gauntlet down:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Come conquer me and take thy toll."</span><br />
<br />
No cowardice or fear she knows,<br />
But, as once more she girds, there grows<br />
An unresignèd hopelessness<br />
From memory of former stress.<br />
Head bent, she muses whilst he waits:<br />
How with such weapons dint his plates?<br />
How quell this vast and sleepless giant<br />
Calmly, immortally defiant,<br />
<br />
How fell him, bind him, and control<br />
With a silver cord and a golden bowl?<br />

Dark firtops foot the moony sky,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Blue moonlight bars the drive;</span><br />
Here at the open window I<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sit smoking and alive.</span><br />
<br />
Wind in the branches swells and breaks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like ocean on a beach;</span><br />
Deep in the sky and my heart there wakes<br />

Death in the cold grey morning<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Came to the man where he lay;</span><br />
And the wind shivered, and the tree shuddered<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the dawn was grey.</span><br />
<br />
And the face of the man was grey in the dawn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the watchers by the bed</span><br />
Knew, as they heard the shaking of the leaves,<br />

I<br />
<br />
When the clouds hide the sun away<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The tall slate roof is dull and grey,</span><br />
And when the rain adown it streams<br />
'Tis polished lead with pale-blue gleams.<br />
<br />
When the clouds vanish and the rain<br />
Stops, and the sun comes out again,<br />
It shimmers golden in the sun<br />
Almost too bright to look upon.<br />
<br />
But soon beneath the steady rays<br />
The roof is dried and reft of blaze,<br />
'Tis dusty yellow traversed through<br />
By long thin lines of deepest blue.<br />
<br />
Then at the last, as night draws near,<br />
The lines grow faint and disappear,<br />
The roof becomes a purple mist<br />
A great square darkening amethyst<br />
<br />
Which sinks into the gathering shade<br />
Till separate form and colour fade,<br />
And it is but a patch which mars<br />
The beauty of a field of stars.<br />
<br />

<br />
It stands so lonely in the sky<br />
The sparrows never come anigh,<br />
The glossy starlings seldom stop<br />
To preen and chatter on the top.<br />
<br />
For a whole week sometimes up there<br />
No wing-wave stirs the quiet air,<br />
The roof lies silent and serene<br />
As though no life had ever been;<br />
<br />
Till some bright afternoon, athwart<br />
The edge two sudden shadows dart,<br />
And two white pigeons with pink feet<br />
Flutter above and pitch on it.<br />
<br />
Jerking their necks out as they walk<br />
They talk awhile their pigeon-talk,<br />
A low continuous murmur blent<br />
Of mock reproaches and content.<br />
<br />
Then cease, and sit there warm and white<br />
An hour, till in the fading light<br />
They wake, and know the close of day,<br />
Flutter above, and fly away,<br />
<br />
Leaving the roof whereon they sat<br />
As 'twas before, a peaceful flat<br />
Expanse, as silent and serene<br />
As though no life had ever been.<br />

There beyond my window ledge,<br />
Heaped against the sky a hedge<br />
Of huge and wavering treetops stands<br />
With multitudes of fluttering hands.<br />
<br />
Wave they, beat they to and fro,<br />
Never stillness may they know,<br />
Plunged by the wind and hurled and torn<br />
Anguished, purposeless, forlorn.<br />
<br />
"O ferocious, O despairing,<br />
In huddled isolation faring<br />
Through a scattered universe,<br />
Lost coins from the Almighty's purse!"<br />
<br />
"No, below you do not see<br />
The firm foundations of the tree;<br />
Anchored to a rock beneath<br />
We laugh in the hammering tempest's teeth."<br />

On an adamantine star;<br />

This dense hard ground I tread<br />
These iron bars that ripple past,<br />
Will they unshaken stand when I am dead<br />
And my deep thoughts outlast?<br />
<br />
Is it my spirit slips,<br />
Falls, like this leaf I kick aside;<br />
This firmness that I feel about my lips,<br />
Is it but empty pride?<br />
<br />
Mute knowledge conquers me;<br />
I contemplate them as they are,<br />
Faint earth and shadowy bars that shake and flee,<br />
Less hard, more transient far<br />
<br />
Than those unbodied hues<br />
The sunset flings on the calm river;<br />
And, as I look, a swiftness thrills my shoes<br />
And my hands with empire quiver.<br />
<br />
Now light the ground I tread,<br />
I walk not now but rather float;<br />
Clear but unreal is the scene outspread,<br />
Pitiful, thin, remote.<br />
<br />
Poor vapour is the grass,<br />
So frail the trees and railings seem,<br />
That, did I sweep my hand around, 'twould pass<br />
Through them, as in a dream.<br />
<br />
Godlike I fear no changes;<br />
Shatter the world with thunders loud,<br />
Still would I ray-like flit about the ranges<br />
Of dark and ruddy cloud.<br />

There is a wood where the fairies dance<br />
All night long in a ring of mushrooms daintily,<br />
By each tree bole sits a squirrel or a mole,<br />
And the moon through the branches darts.<br />
<br />
Light on the grass their slim limbs glance,<br />
Their shadows in the moonlight swing in quiet unison,<br />
And the moon discovers that they all have lovers,<br />
But they never break their hearts.<br />
<br />
They never grieve at all for sands that run,<br />
They never know regret for a deed that's done,<br />
And they never think of going to a shed with a gun<br />
At the rising of the sun.<br />

<br />
Mostly in a dull rotation<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We bear our loads and eat and drink and sleep,</span><br />
Feeling no tears, knowing no meditation&mdash;<br />
Too tired to think, too clogged with earth to weep.<br />
<br />
Dimly convinced, poor groping wretches,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like eyeless insects in a murky pond</span><br />
That out and out this city stretches,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Away, away, and there is no beyond.</span><br />
<br />
No larger earth, no loftier heaven,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No cleaner, gentler airs to breathe. And yet,</span><br />
Even to us sometimes is given<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Visions of things we otherwhiles forget.</span><br />
<br />
Some day is done, its labour ended,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And as we brood at windows high,</span><br />
A steady wind from far descended,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Blows off the filth that hid the deeper sky;</span><br />
<br />
There are the empty waiting spaces,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We watch, we watch, unwinking, pale and dumb,</span><br />
Till gliding up with noiseless paces<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Night sweeps o'er all the wide arch: Night has come.</span><br />
<br />
Not that sick false night of the city,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lurid and low and yellow and obscene,</span><br />
But mother Night, pure, full of pity,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The star-strewn Night, blue, potent and serene.</span><br />
<br />
O, as we gaze the clamour ceases,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The turbid world around grows dim and small,</span><br />
The soft-shed influence releases<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our shrouded spirits from their dusty pall.</span><br />
<br />
No more we hear the turbulent traffic,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not scorned but unremembered is the day;</span><br />
The Night, all luminous and seraphic,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has brushed its heavy memories away.</span><br />
<br />
The great blue Night so clear and kindly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The little stars so wide-eyed and so still,</span><br />
Open a door for souls that blindly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had wandered, tunnelling the endless hill;</span><br />
<br />
They draw the long-untraversed portal,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our souls slip out and tremble and expand,</span><br />
The immortal feels for the immortal,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The eternal holds the eternal by the hand.</span><br />
<br />
Impalpably we are led and lifted,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Softly we shake into the gulf of blue,</span><br />
The last environing veil is rifted<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And lost horizons float into our view.</span><br />
<br />
Lost lands, lone seas, lands that afar gleam<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a miraculous beauty, faint yet clear,</span><br />
Forgotten lands of night and star-gleam,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seas that are somewhere but that are not here.</span><br />
<br />
Borne without effort or endeavour,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Swifter and more ethereal than the wind,</span><br />
In level track we stream, whilst ever<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fair pale panorama rolls behind.</span><br />
<br />
Now fleets below a trancèd moorland,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A sweep of glimmering immobility;</span><br />
Now craggy cliff and dented foreland<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pass back and there beyond unfolds the sea.</span><br />
<br />
Now wastes of water heaving, drawing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Great darkling tracts of patterned restlessness,</span><br />
With whitened waves round rough rocks mawing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And licking islands in their fierce caress.</span><br />
<br />
Now coasts with capes and ribboned beaches<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Set silent 'neath the canopy sapphirine,</span><br />
And estuaries and river reaches<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Phantasmal silver in the night's soft shine.</span><br />

<p class="poem">
Ah, these fair woods the spirit crosses,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">These quiet lakes, these stretched dreaming fields,</span><br />
These undulate downs with piny bosses<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pointing the ridges of their sloping shields.</span><br />
<br />
These valleys and these heights that screen them,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">These tawnier sands where grass and tree are not,</span><br />
Ah, we have known them, we have seen them<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Long, long ago or ever we forgot;</span><br />
<br />
We know them all, these placid countries,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And what the pathway is and what the goal;</span><br />
These are the gates and these the sentries<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That guard the ancient fortress of the soul.</span><br />
<br />
And onward speed we flying, flying,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over the sundering worlds of hill and plain</span><br />
To where they rear their heads undying<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The unnamed mountains of old days again.</span><br />
<br />
The snows upon their calm still summits,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The chasms, the lines of trees that foot the snow,</span><br />
Curving like inky frozen comets,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into the forest-ocean spread below.</span><br />
<br />
The glisten where the peaks are hoarest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The soundless darkness of the sunken vales,</span><br />
The folding leagues of shadowy forest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wave beyond wave till all distinctness fails.</span><br />
<br />
So invulnerable it is, so deathless,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So floods the air the loveliness of it,</span><br />
That we stay dazzled, rapt and breathless,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our beings ebbing to the infinite.</span><br />
<br />
There as we pause, there as we hover,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Moveless in ecstasy, a sudden light</span><br />
Breaks in our eyes, and we discover<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We sit at windows gazing to the night.</span><br />
<br />
Wistful and tired, with eyes a-tingle<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where still the sting of Beauty faintly smarts,</span><br />
But with our mute regrets there mingle<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thanks for the resurrection of our hearts.</span><br />
<br />
O night so great that will not mock us!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O stars so wise that understand the weak!</span><br />
O vast consoling hands that rock us!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O strong and perfect tongues that speak!</span><br />
<br />
O night enrobed in azure splendour!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O whispering stars whose radiance falls like dew!</span><br />
O mighty presences and tender,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You have given us back the dreams our childhood knew!</span><br />
<br />
Lulled by your visions without number,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We seek our beds content and void of pain,</span><br />
And dreaming drowse and dreaming slumber<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And dreaming wake to see the day again.</span><br />

<br />
<br />
The cord broke, and the tent<br />
Slipped, and the silken roof<br />
Lay prone beneath the viewless hoof<br />
Of the deliberate firmament.<br />
Yet cared we not; how should we care?<br />
Knowing that labourless now he breathes<br />
A golden paradisal air<br />
Where with more certain craft he wreathes<br />
Bright braids of words more wise and fair<br />
Than ever his earthly fabrics were,<br />
That his unwavering eyes made fresh,<br />
Purged and regarbed in fadeless flesh,<br />
What he then darkly guessed behold,<br />
And watch with an abiding joy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The eternal mysteries unfold</span><br />
Which do his now transfigured songs evermore employ.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Brother, yet great thy power;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thou stood'st as on a tower</span><br />
Small 'neath the stars yet high above the fields;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In thy alembic song</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Imagination strong</span><br />
Distilled what essences the quest to mortals yields.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">This thy reward well-won,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For every morning's sun</span><br />
Found thy heart's firm allegiance still unshaken;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">No temporal ache or smart</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Drave Beauty from thy heart,</span><br />
And by thy mighty mistress never wast forsaken.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Yes; for though stringent was the test,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When that thy trial was bitterest,</span><br />
Steadfast thou did'st remain; unshod<br />
The harrows of Pain thy feet once trod,<br />
Humiliate as thy sad song tells<br />
Before the vault's white sentinels.<br />
Friendless and faint thou sojourned'st there,<br />
A bowed, brave, timid wanderer,<br />
A lonely nomad of the spirit,<br />
Who did a triple curse inherit,<br />
Hunger, regret and memory.<br />
Yet never did they vanquish thee;<br />
When nighest broken, most alone,<br />
Thy unassuagèd thoughts could clamber<br />
To beauty on her ageless throne;<br />
Thou wert as one in torture chamber<br />
Who sees the blue through an open casement<br />
And hammers his soul to endure the time<br />
Of his corporeal abasement;<br />
Nor writhed'st at thine or others' fault,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But with grim tenderness did salt</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thy cicatrices with a rhyme.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Not the most sable flame of gloom</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Could penetrate thy inmost room;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But through the walls thy spirit sucked</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Into that cloistral hermitage</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Stray lovely things, moonbeams and snows</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The far sky shed into thy cage,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And, from the very gutter plucked,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A lost and mired campestral rose.</span><br />
<br />
Ended that purgatorial period,<br />
Filled was thy wallet and thy feet were shod,<br />
The leaden weights were moved, the rack withdrawn,<br />
Thou didst traverse the dewy fields of dawn,<br />
Watch sunsets blazoning over upland turf,<br />
Pull poppies from the frontiers of the surf,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Dwelled'st with love and human eyes</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Vigilant, calm and wise.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But still as when thy bark did ride</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Derelict on the city's tide,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As then for penury now for pride</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thy bodily senses were denied;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Though they cried out and would not sleep,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ascetic thou didst armour them</span><br />
Lest acid pleasure should eat thine art's pure gem.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Hourly the tempter's ambuscades</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But thou didst guard the gates and keep</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thy senses' hungry colonnades</span><br />
Accessible but to Beauty's ministers,<br />
Unlit by any ruby flame but hers.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Immuring so thy spirit eager</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Within a body frail and meagre,</span><br />
Far from the meads of earthly milk and honey,<br />
Yet franchised of more wondrous territories,<br />
Like those poor Bedouin of Arabia the Stony<br />
Who roam spare-fed and hollow-eyed but free<br />
By day to wander and by night to camp<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In vast serenity,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Compassed by God's great silent glories</span><br />
The sun's gold splendour and the moon's white lamp,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Folded and safe from harm</span><br />
Beneath the mighty sky's protecting arm.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ha! but the Titan's ardour</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Wherewith thou scour'dst the vast,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of fruits of heavenly taste!</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And serene burning brow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Worthy of thy great lineage, thou</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Drankest without a shudder</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In proud humility</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Milk from that vast primæval udder</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That swells for such as thee,</span><br />
Milk from the fountains of the Universe<br />
That cowards deem infected with a curse,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That flushes him who drinks</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Nor shrinks</span><br />
The exalted anguish of diurnal draughts<br />
To a clear vision, more intolerable<br />
In its blissful pain, than love's most ardent shafts,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of the seats where she doth dwell,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She, whom thou didst confess</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Enticed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thee hot to her throne to press</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For the greater glory of Christ</span><br />
To uplift the curtains of her closed eyes.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Not all was for thy learning</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nor any mortal's else;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Only for thy discerning</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sporadic syllables</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of those supernal glances</span><br />
Coffer of which her marble countenance is,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Yet vain was not the adventure,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Reluctant though the prize,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thou gainedst a debenture</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On the fringe of Beauty's eyes;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Such fragmentary trophy</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As some cross-tunic'd knight</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From Saladin or Sophy</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">May have won in sword's despite,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Not the dear polar shrines</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Held captive by the Paynim</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But still as fruit of wars</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Some stone from Sion's lines,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Some relic that might sain him</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of life's uncounted scars.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Self-dedicated anchorite,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Never disdainful of the dust,</span><br />
But conscious of the overcoming night<br />
That must engulph the blooms and berries of lust,<br />
And unforgetful of the enveloping day beyond;<br />
Though a sweet show was spread for thy delight<br />
Resolved not to be so fond<br />
As, in ephemeral gauds caparisoned,<br />
To station feet upon a world of vapour<br />
Soft as a dream and fleeting as a taper;<br />
Thou thoughtest nevertheless that thou shouldst occupy<br />
Thyself, as it seemed to thee, most worthily<br />
Until the rapid hour when thou shouldst die;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So, in a world of seemings,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of shadows and of dreamings,</span><br />
Busied thyself to fashion and record<br />
Unto the greater glory of thy Lord,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For thy proud lady Beauty His</span><br />
Most excellent and humble handmaid is.<br />
Says one thy service was too ceremonial,<br />
Thy vestments irised overmuch, thy ritual<br />
Too elaborate and thy rubric too obscure,<br />
Therefore thy gift of chant and orison<br />
Beneath the perfect service men have done.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O but thy notes were pure,</span><br />
And in a day like this we now endure<br />
No fault it was in thee to set thy camp<br />

'Gainst the mephitic odours of the swamp.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which being so, no gain</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Twere to explain</span><br />
An exquisiteness too meticulous;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Let us but say it pleased thee thus,</span><br />
Dowered with imagination heavy-fruited,<br />
To raise a column garlanded and fluted<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For Him thy heavenly abacus.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">This was thine offering thou didst make</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In founded hope that He</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The craftsman's best would take</span><br />
Well knowing its unobscure sincerity.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The cord broke and the tent</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Slipped and the silken roof</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And all meek thanks and all belief</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Hardly suffice to rampart grief.</span><br />
For gone is Beauty's votary apostolic<br />
And are her temples now delivered over<br />
To blindworms and libidinous goats that frolic<br />
In places hallowed by that celestial lover.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Save only two or three</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With undivided minds like thee,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">None now remains that girds</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The peregrinal loin,</span><br />
None reverent of Beauty's holy tongue,<br />
But counterfeiters of her imaged coin,<br />
Iconoclasts, breakers of carven words,<br />
Seekers of worthless treasure in the dung,<br />
Mock mages and cacophonous charlatans,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And pismire artisans</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Labouring to make</span><br />
Such mirrored replicas of Nature's face<br />
As might the surface of a stagnant lake.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Yet we should anger not,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nor let that be forgot,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The testament of stateliest worth</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He left us when he fled the earth.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The mausoleum made of rhyme,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Fair in its unfrequented field,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which shall invulnerably shield</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">His memory to the end of Time;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The house with curtain-flaming halls</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And roof of gold and jewelled walls</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For which the fisher sank his net</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Into the deepest pools of speech,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Scooping rich conchs and ribbons wet</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That a less venturous could not reach,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The hunter tracked the metaphor</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On many a foamy silver coast</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A hundred leagues beyond the most</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Fabulous Tellurian shore.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Magnificent he was and mild,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Glad to be still and glad to speak,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Daring yet delicate as a child,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Faithful, compassionate and holy,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And, being human, strong and weak,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And full of hope and melancholy.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">No more than we, able to shed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Man's nature he inherited,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Neither sin's garrison to kill,</span><br />
Yet at the last with constancy so great<br />
As the world's vanities to abnegate,<br />
Sternly to will the sacrifice of will<br />
Upon the altars of the Uncreate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So that he lived before he died</span><br />
As one who hourly to himself denied<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">All joys save those that cannot pall,</span><br />
Who having nothing yet had all.<br />

I<br />
<br />
When I was a boy there was a friend of mine,<br />
We thought ourselves warriors and grown folk swine,<br />
Stupid old animals who never understood<br />
And never had an impulse and said "you must be good."<br />
<br />
We slank like stoats and fled like foxes,<br />
We put cigarettes in the pillar-boxes,<br />
Lighted cigarettes and letters all aflame&mdash;<br />
O the surprise when the postman came!<br />
<br />
We stole eggs and apples and made fine hay<br />
In people's houses when people were away,<br />
We broke street lamps and away we ran,<br />
Then I was a boy but now I am a man.<br />
<br />
Now I am a man and don't have any fun,<br />
I hardly ever shout and I never never run,<br />
And I don't care if he's dead that friend of mine,<br />
For then I was a boy and now I am a swine.<br />
<br />
<br />
II<br />
<br />
We met again the other night<br />
With people; you were quite polite,<br />
Shook my hand and spoke awhile<br />
Of common things with cautious smile;<br />
Paid the usual debt men owe<br />
To fellows whom they used to know.<br />
But, when our eyes met full, yours dropped,<br />
And sudden, resolute, you stopped,<br />
Moving with hurried syllables<br />
To make remarks to some one else.<br />
I caught them not, to me they said:<br />
"Let the dead past bury its dead,<br />
Things were very different then,<br />
Boys are fools and men are men."<br />
Several times the other night<br />
You did your best to be polite;<br />
When in the conversation's round<br />
You heard my tongue's familiar sound<br />
You bent in eager pose my way<br />
To hear what I had got to say;<br />
Trying, you thought with some success,<br />
To hide the chasm's nakedness.<br />
But on your eyes hard films there lay;<br />
No mock-interest, no pretence<br />
Could veil your blank indifference;<br />
And if thoughts came recalling things<br />
Far-off, far-off, from those old springs<br />
When underneath the moon and sun<br />
Our separate pulses beat as one,<br />
Vagrant tender thoughts that asked<br />
Admittance found the portal masked;<br />
You spurned them; when I'd said my say,<br />
With laugh and nod you turned away<br />
To toss your friends some easy jest<br />
That smote my brow and stabbed my breast.<br />
Foolish though it be and vain<br />
I am not master of my pain,<br />
And when I said good-night to you<br />
I hoped we should not meet again,<br />
And wondered how the soul I knew<br />
Could change so much; have I changed too?<br />
<br />

III<br />
<br />
There was a man whom I knew well<br />
Whose choice it was to live in hell;<br />
Reason there was why that was so<br />
But what it was I do not know.<br />
<br />
He had a room high in a tower,<br />
And sat there drinking hour by hour,<br />
Drinking, drinking all alone<br />
With candles and a wall of stone.<br />
<br />
Now and then he sobered down,<br />
And stayed a night with me in town.<br />
If he found me with a crowd,<br />
He shrank and did not speak aloud.<br />
<br />
He sat in a corner silently,<br />
And others of the company<br />
Would note his curious face and eye,<br />
His twitching face and timid eye.<br />
<br />
When they saw the eye he had<br />
They thought perhaps that he was mad.<br />
I knew he was clear and sane<br />
But had a horror in his brain.<br />
<br />
He had much money and one friend<br />
And drank quite grimly to the end.<br />
Why he chose to die in hell<br />
I did not ask, he did not tell.<br />

When London was a little town<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lean by the river's marge,</span><br />
The poet paced it with a frown,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He thought it very large.</span><br />
<br />
He loved bright ship and pointing steeple<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bridge with houses loaded</span><br />
And priests and many-coloured people ...<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But ah, they were not woaded!</span><br />
<br />
Not all the walls could shed the spell<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of meres and marshes green,</span><br />
Nor any chaffering merchant tell<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The beauty that had been:</span><br />
<br />
The crying birds at fall of night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fisher in his coracle,</span><br />
And grim on Ludgate's windy height,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An oak-tree and an oracle.</span><br />
<br />
Sick for the past his hair he rent<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And dropt a tear in season;</span><br />
If he had cause for his lament<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We have much better reason.</span><br />
<br />
For now the fields and paths he knew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are coffined all with bricks,</span><br />
The lucid silver stream he knew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Runs slimy as the Styx;</span><br />
<br />
North and south and east and west,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Far as the eye can travel,</span><br />
Earth with a sombre web is drest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That nothing can unravel.</span><br />
<br />
And we must wear as black a frown,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wail with as keen a woe</span><br />
That London was a little town<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Five hundred years ago.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">High in a world of wires,</span><br />

There in the dawns of summer days<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I stand in adoration,</span><br />
While London's robed in rainbow haze<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And gold illumination.</span><br />
<br />
The wizard breezes waft the rays<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shot by the waking sun,</span><br />
A myriad chimneys softly blaze,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A myriad shadows run.</span><br />
<br />
Round the wide rim in radiant mist<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The gentle suburbs quiver,</span><br />
And nearer lies the shining twist<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Thames, a holy river</span><br />

Left and right my vision drifts,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By yonder towers I linger,</span><br />
Where Westminster's cathedral lifts<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its belled Byzantine finger,</span><br />

And here against my perchèd home<br />

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Where bright immortal people are;</span><br />
Remote from hollow shame and pity,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their portals frame no guiding star</span><br />
But blightless pleasure's moteless rays<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That follow their footsteps as they dance</span><br />
Long lutanied measures through a maze<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of flower-like song and dalliance.</span><br />
<br />
There always glows the vernal sun,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There happy birds for ever sing,</span><br />
There faint perfumèd breezes run<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through branches of eternal spring;</span><br />
There faces browned and fruit and milk<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And blue-winged words and rose-bloomed kisses</span><br />
In galleys gowned with gold and silk<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shake on a lake of dainty blisses.</span><br />
<br />
Coyness is not, nor bear they thought<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Save of a shining gracious flow,</span><br />
All natural joys are temperate sought,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For calm desire there they know,</span><br />
A fire promiscuous, languorous, kind;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They scorn all fiercer lusts and quarrels,</span><br />
Nor blow about on anger's wind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor burn with love, nor rust with morals.</span><br />
<br />
Folk in the far unfading city,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Burning with lusts my senses are,</span><br />
I am torn with love and shame and pity,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Be to my heart a guiding star</span><br />
Wise youths and maidens in the sun,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With eyes that charm and lips that sing,</span><br />
And gentle arms that rippling run,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shed on my heart your endless spring!</span><br />

How could we clear his charms rehearse?<br />

High on a down we found him last,<br />
Shy as a hare, he fled as fast;<br />
How could we clasp him or ever he passed?<br />

How could we cling to his limbs that shone,<br />
Ravish his cheeks' red gonfalon,<br />
Or the wild-skin cloak that he had on?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fleet are his feet and his heart apart.</span><br />
<br />
For the wind of his feet still straightly shaping,<br />
He loosed at our breasts from his eyes escaping<br />
One crooked swift glance like a javelin leaping.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fleet are his feet and his heart apart.</span><br />
<br />
And his feet passed over the sunset land<br />
From the place forlorn where a forlorn band<br />
Watching him flying we still did stand.<br />

Where they housed me and fed me<br />

You that sit there smiling, you<br />
Know that what I say is true.<br />

My head is very small to touch,<br />

An eared round that weighs not much,<br />
Eyes, nose-holes, and a pulpy crack:<br />
Oh, how small, how small it is!<br />
How could countries be in this?<br />

Walk the streets with steps demure.<br />

In its clean groves and spacious halls<br />

Hold innocent sunny festivals<br />

Things that destroy, distort, deface,<br />
Come never to that lovely place.<br />

Never could evil enter thither,<br />

All cunning things that creep and fly<br />
To suck men's blood until they die.<br />

But now and then some sable shape<br />

And men stand stonied or distraught<br />
To know the loathly deed or thought.<br />

But, ah! beyond the marsh you reach<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A purulent place more vile than all,</span><br />
A festering lake too foul for speech,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rotten and black, with coils acrawl,</span><br />
Where writhe with lecherous squeakings shrill<br />
Horrors that make the heart stand still.<br />
<br />
There, 'neath a heaven diseased, it lies,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The mere alive with slimy worms,</span><br />

<br />
[To F., who complained of his vagueness and lack of<br />
dogmatic statement]<br />
<br />
<br />
Not, I suppose, since I deny<br />
Appearance is reality,<br />
And doubt the substance of the earth<br />
Does your remonstrance come to birth;<br />
Not that at once I both affirm<br />
'Tis not the skin that makes the worm<br />
And every tactile thing with mass<br />
Must find its symbol in the grass<br />
And with a cool conviction say<br />
Even a critic's more than clay<br />
And every dog outlives his day.<br />
This kind of vagueness suits your view,<br />
You would not carp at it; for you<br />
Did never stand with those who take<br />
Their pleasures in a world opaque.<br />
For you a tree would never be<br />
Lovely were it but a tree,<br />
And earthly splendours never splendid<br />
If by transience unattended.<br />
Your eyes are on a farther shore<br />
Than any of earth; you not adore<br />
As godhead God's dead hieroglyph,<br />
Nor would you be perturbed if<br />
Some prophet with a voice of thunder<br />
And avalanche arm should blast and founder<br />
The logical pillars that maintain<br />
This visible world which loads the brain,<br />
Loads the brain and withers the heart<br />
And holds man from his God apart.<br />
<br />
But still with you remains the craving<br />
For some more solid substance, having<br />
Surface to touch, colour to see,<br />
And form compact in symmetry.<br />
You are not satisfied with these<br />
Vague throbbings, utterless ecstasies,<br />
Void finds your spirit of delight<br />
This great indefinite white light,<br />
Not with such sickles can you reap;<br />
If a dense earth you cannot keep<br />
You want a dense heaven as substitute<br />
With trees of plump celestial fruit,<br />
Red apples, golden pomegranates,<br />
And a river flowing by tall gates<br />
Of topaz and of chrysolite<br />
And walls of twenty cubits height.<br />
<br />
Frank, you cry out against the age!<br />
Nor you nor I can disengage<br />
Ourselves from that in which we live<br />
Nor seize on things God does not give.<br />
Thirsty as you, perhaps, I long<br />
For courtyards of eternal song,<br />
Even as yours my feet would stray<br />
In a city where 'tis always day<br />
And a green spontaneous leafy garden<br />
With God in the middle for a warden;<br />
But though I trust with strengthening faith<br />
I'll taste when I have traversed death<br />
The unimaginable sweetness<br />
Of certitude of such concreteness,<br />
How should I draw the hue and scope<br />
Of substances I only hope<br />
Or blaze upon a mortal screen<br />
The evidence of things not seen?<br />
This art of ours but grows and stirs<br />
Experience when it registers,<br />
And you know well as I know well<br />
This autumn of time in which we dwell<br />
Is not an age of revelations<br />
Solid as once, but intimations<br />
That touch us with warm misty fingers<br />
Leaving a nameless sense that lingers<br />
That sight is blind and Time's a snare<br />
And earth less solid than the air<br />
And deep below all seeming things<br />
There sits a steady king of kings<br />
A radiant ageless permanence,<br />
A quenchless fount of virtue whence<br />
We draw our life; a sense that makes<br />
A staunch conviction nothing shakes<br />
Of our own immortality.<br />
And though, being man, with certain glee<br />
I eat and drink, though I suffer pain,<br />
And love and hate and love again<br />
Well or in mode contemptible,<br />
Thus shackled by the body's spell<br />
I see through pupils of the beast<br />
Though it be faint and blurred with mist<br />
A Star that travels in the East.<br />
<br />
I see what I can, not what I will<br />
In things that move, things that are still,<br />
Thin motion, even cloudier rest,<br />
I see the symbols God hath drest<br />
The moveless trees, the trees that wave<br />
The clouds that heavenly highways have,<br />
Horses that run, rocks that are fixt,<br />
Streams that have rest and motion mixt,<br />
The main with its abiding flux,<br />
The wind that up my chimney sucks<br />
A mounting waterfall of flame,<br />
Sticks, straws, dust, beetles and that same<br />
Old blazing sun the Psalmist saw<br />
A testifier to the law.<br />
Divinely to the heart they speak<br />
Saying how they are but weak<br />
Wan will o' the wisps o'er the crystal sea;<br />
But stays that sea still dark to me.<br />
<br />
Did I now glibly insolent<br />
Chart the ulterior firmament,<br />
Would you not know my words were lies,<br />
Where not my testimonial eyes<br />
Mortal or spiritual lodge,<br />
Mere uncorroborated fudge?<br />
Praise me, though praise I do not want,<br />
Rather, that I have cast much cant,<br />
That what I see and feel I write<br />
Read what I can in this dim light<br />
Granted to me in nether night.<br />
And though I am vague and shrink to guess<br />
God's everlasting purposes,<br />
And never save in perplext dream<br />
Have caught the least authentic gleam<br />
Of the great kingdom and the throne<br />
In the world that lies behind our own,<br />
I have not lacked my certainties,<br />
I have not haggard moaned the skies,<br />
Now waged unnecessary strife<br />
Nor scorned nor overvalued life.<br />
And though you say my attitude<br />
Is questioning, concede my mood<br />
Does never bring to tongue or pen<br />
Accents of gloomy modern men<br />
Who wail or hail the death of God<br />
And weigh and measure man the clod,<br />
Or say they draw reluctant breath<br />
And musically mourn that Death<br />
Is a queen omnipotent of woe<br />
And Life her lean cicisbeo,<br />
Abject and pale, whom vampire-like<br />
She playeth with ere she shall strike,<br />
And pose sad riddles to the Sphinx<br />
With raven quills in purple inks,...<br />
Then send the boy to fetch more drinks.<br />

This morning in my attic high<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Demon came to visit me,</span><br />
And seeking faults in my reply,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He said: "I would inquire of thee,</span><br />
<br />
"Of all the beauties which compose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her charming body's potent spell,</span><br />
Of all the objects black and rose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which make the thing you love so well,</span><br />
<br />
"Which is the sweetest?" O my soul!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou didst rejoin: "How tell of parts,</span><br />
When all I know is that the whole<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Works magic in my heart of hearts?</span><br />
<br />
"Where all is fair, how should I say<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What single grace is my delight?</span><br />
She shines on me like break of day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And she consoles me as the night.</span><br />
<br />
"There flows through all her perfect frame<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A harmony too exquisite</span><br />
That weak analysis should name<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The numberless accords of it.</span><br />
<br />
"O mystic metamorphosis!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My separate senses all are blent;</span><br />
Within her breath soft music is,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in her voice a subtle scent!"</span><br />

When the low heavy sky weighs like a lid<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon the spirit aching for the light</span><br />
And all the wide horizon's line is hid<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By a black day sadder than any night;</span><br />
<br />
When the changed earth is but a dungeon dank<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where batlike Hope goes blindly fluttering</span><br />
And, striking wall and roof and mouldered plank,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bruises his tender head and timid wing;</span><br />
<br />
When like grim prison-bars stretch down the thin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Straight, rigid pillars of the endless rain,</span><br />
And the dumb throngs of infamous spiders spin<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their meshes in the caverns of the brain;&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
Suddenly, bells leap forth into the air,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hurling a hideous uproar to the sky</span><br />
As 'twere a band of homeless spirits who fare<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through the strange heavens, wailing stubbornly.</span><br />
<br />
And hearses, without drum or instrument,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">File slowly through my soul; crushed, sorrowful,</span><br />
Weeps Hope, and Grief, fierce and omnipotent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Plants his black banner on my drooping skull.</span><br />

My heart was like a bird and took to flight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Around the rigging circling joyously;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The ship rolled on beneath a cloudless sky</span><br />
Like a great angel drunken with the light.<br />
<br />
"What is yon isle, sad and funereal?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Cythera famed in deathless song," said they,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"The gay old bachelors' Eldorado-Nay,</span><br />
Look! 'tis a poor bare country after all!"<br />
<br />
Isle of sweet secrets and heart banquetings!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The queenly shade of antique Venus thrills</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Scentlike above thy level seas and fills</span><br />
Our souls with languor and all amorous things.<br />
<br />
Fair isle and of green myrtles and blown flowers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Held holy by all men for evermore,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where the faint sighs of spirits that adore</span><br />
Float like rose-incense through the quiet hours,<br />
<br />
And dovelike sounds each murmured orison:&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cythera lay there barren 'neath bright skies,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A rocky waste rent by discordant cries:</span><br />
Natheless I saw a curious thing thereon.<br />
<br />
No shady temple was it, close enshrined<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I' the trees; no flower-crowned priestess hither came</span><br />
With her young body burnt by secret flame,<br />
Baring her breast to the caressing wind;<br />
<br />
But when so close to the land's edge we drew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our canvas scared the sea-fowl&mdash;gradually</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We knew it for a three-branched gallows tree</span><br />
Like a black cypress stark against the blue.<br />
<br />
A rotten carcase hung, whereon did sit<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A swarm of foul black birds; with writhe and shriek</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each sought to pierce and plunge his knife-like beak</span><br />
Deep in the bleeding trunk and limbs of it.<br />
<br />
The eyes were holes; the belly opened wide<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Streaming its heavy entrails on the thighs;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The grim birds, gorged with dreadful delicacies,</span><br />
Had dug and furrowed it on every side.<br />
<br />
Beneath the blackened feet there strove and pressed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A herd of jealous beasts with upward snout,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in the midst of these there turned about</span><br />
One, the chief hangman, larger than the rest....<br />
<br />
Lone Cytherean! now all silently<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou sufferest these insults to atone</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For those old infamous sins that thou hast known,</span><br />
The sins that locked the gate o' the grave to thee.<br />
<br />
Mine are thy sorrows, ludicrous corse; yea, all<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are mine! I stood thy swaying limbs beneath,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, like a bitter vomit, to my teeth</span><br />
There rose old shadows in a stream of gall.<br />
<br />
O thou unhappy devil, I felt afresh,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gazing at thee, the beaks and jaws of those</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Black savage panthers and those ruthless crows,</span><br />
Who loved of old to macerate my flesh.<br />
<br />
The sea was calm, the sky without a cloud;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Henceforth for me all things that came to pass</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were blood and darkness,&mdash;round my heart, alas!</span><br />
There clung that allegory, like a shroud.<br />
<br />
Naught save mine image on a gibbet thrust<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Found I on Venus island desolate....</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah, God! the courage and strength to contemplate</span><br />
My body and my heart without disgust.<br />

The distant memories which slowly throng,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Brought by the chime soft-singing through the mist.</span><br />
<br />
Happy the sturdy, vigorous-throated bell<br />

Cries hourly, like some strong old sentinel<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Flinging the ready challenge from his tent.</span><br />
<br />
For me, my soul is cracked; when sick with care,<br />
She strives with songs to people the cold air<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It happens often that her feeble cries</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mock the harsh rattle of a man who lies</span><br />
Wounded, forgotten, 'neath a mound of slain<br />
And dies, pinned fast, writhing his limbs in pain.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Until at last the day is done,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And driving down the slanting sun,</span><br />
The sad night is victorious.<br />
<br />
They teach the wise who gives them ear<br />
That in this world he most should fear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All things which loud or restless be.</span><br />
<br />
Who, dazzled by a passing shade,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Follows it, never will be free</span><br />
Till the dread penalty be paid.<br />
